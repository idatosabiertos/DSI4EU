                        <p><strong>Nesta</strong> is an innovation charity with a mission to help people and
                            organisations bring great ideas to life. Nesta &nbsp;invests in &nbsp;early-stage &nbsp;companies,
                            informs &nbsp;policy &nbsp;and delivers practical programmes &nbsp;that &nbsp;inspire others
                            to solve the big challenges of the future. Nesta has been a key champion in the UK for the
                            idea that innovation comes from open, collaborative approaches to problem solving and has
                            undertaken research and policy work, as well as practical programmes, to demonstrate this.

                        <p><strong>Waag Society</strong> — institute for art, science and technology — is a pioneer in
                            the field of digital media. Over the past 22 years, the foundation has developed into an
                            institution of international stature, a platform for artistic research and experimentation,
                            and has become both a catalyst for events and a breeding ground for cultural and social
                            innovation. Waag Society explores emerging technologies, and provides art and culture with a
                            central role in the designing of new applications for novel advances in science and
                            technology. The organisation concerns itself not only with technologies related to the
                            Internet, but also with those related to biotechnology and the cognitive sciences.</p>

                            Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland. The laboratory applies interaction design
                            methods and a human-centered design perspective to develop research projects focusing on
                            people experiences mediated by the internet and digital technologies. LCV researches and
                            develops educational models that explore the convergence of technology and design via
                            prototyping and promote the integration of bottom-up innovation models and community-driven
                            approaches in the design research and education. LCV leads projects of social innovation
                            related to environmental sustainability and energy consumption, and international programs
                            on interaction design, physical computing, open design, DIY electronics, digital
