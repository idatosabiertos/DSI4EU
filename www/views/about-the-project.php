                <p class="intro">Digital technologies and the internet have transformed many
                    areas of business â€“ from Google and Amazon to Airbnb and Kickstarter. Huge sums of public money have
                    supported digital innovation in business, as well as in fields ranging from the military to
                    espionage. But there has been much less systematic support for innovations that use digital
                    technology to address social challenges.</p>
                <p>Across Europe a growing movement of tech entrepreneurs are developing
                    inspiring digital solutions to social challenges. These range from social networks for those living
                    with chronic health conditions, to online platforms for citizen participation in policymaking, to
                    using open data to create more transparency about public spending. We call this digital social
                    innovation (DSI)We have set up digitalsocial.eu &nbsp;to build a network of digital social
                    innovation in Europe. People and projects interested in DSI can use the site to showcase their work,
                    learn about DSI , find collaborators for future projects &nbsp;and find information on events and
                    funding opportunities for DSI.</p>
