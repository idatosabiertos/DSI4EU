                <p class="intro">Digital technologies and the internet have transformed many areas of business â€“ from
                    Google and Amazon to Airbnb and Kickstarter. Huge sums of public money have supported digital
                    innovation in business, as well as in fields ranging from the military to espionage. But there has
                    been much less systematic support for innovations that use digital technology to address social
                    challenges.</p>
                <p>Digital technologies are particularly well suited to helping civic action: mobilising large
                    communities, sharing resources and spreading power. A growing movement of tech entrepreneurs and
                    innovators in civil society are now developing inspiring digital solutions to social challenges.
                    These range from social networks for those living with chronic health conditions, to online
                    platforms for citizen participation in policymaking, to using open data to create more transparency
                    about public spending. We call this digital social innovation (DSI).</p>

                <p>With DSI4EU we are mapping the growing network of people, projects and organisations working on DSI
                    across Europe, and exploring how they play a vital role in involving citizens to address social
                    challenges and shape societies.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Creates</strong> an online resource on www.digitalsocial.eu that enables those
                        interested in, and working on, digital social innovation in Europe to learn about DSI, showcase
                        their work, find new collaborators and learn about events and new funding opportunities.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Engages</strong> the existing communities of digital social innovators in the network.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Carries out</strong> research on how to grow DSI in Europe.</li>
                    <li><strong>Uses insights</strong> about the European DSI network to develop a set of
                        recommendations about how policymakers and funders can best support, engage with and make the
                        most of DSI and ensure it can continue to grow in the future.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Develops a set of tools</strong> that supports people and organisations interested in
                        develop digital solutions that address social challenges.
