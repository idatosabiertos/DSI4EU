2. Genera nuevas expectativas laborales entre la poblacion joven del barrio que siente que puede tener alguna opcion laboral a corto- medio plazo en un sector de futuro. En el caso de Saregune ha significado que, a partir del primer ano de funcionamiento, hemos contado con una media de 60 candidaturas para cada Plan

3. En bastantes casos ha supuesto un retorno al aprendizaje normalizado por parte de personas que, procedentes del fracaso escolar, habian perdido toda esperanza y confianza en el sistema educativo, generando nuevas posibilidades formativas a traves del autoaprendizaje apoyado, la formacion continua y el aprendizaje permanente vinculado a las tecnologias. 
4.

5. Fomenta la creacion y consolidacion de un capital social rico e interconectado. En base a las necesidades tecnologicas se generan sinergias y grupos de interes comun que facilitan el acercamiento y el trabajo compartido entre la iniciativa social. 
6. Ayuda a modificar estereotipos negativos del vecindario tanto hacia las personas del barrio contratadas, cuyo rol pasa a ser de servicio a la comunidad, como entre las personas usuarias que en este entorno pueden sacar a la luz sus conocimientos (de otros idiomas, de manejo de las tecnologias, ..) y romper con muchos prejuicios respecto a las personas extranjeras y otras etnias y sus respectivos usos culturales. 
7. Socializa, desmitifica y horizontaliza el papel de la tecnologia ayudando a ver su papel y uso social, no exclusivamente mercantil. El uso del software libre en el proceso ayuda a profundizar en los valores de la colaboracion, de la creacion compartida del conocimiento y su contribucion a la creacion cultural libre.

VOICE  aims to define and offer a virtual, open innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem based on open innovation, crowd-sourcing and co-creation principles. Innovation and Entrepreneurship are key drivers towards a number of areas of social interest including:

- Job Creation  Start-ups to result from the VOICE ecosystem will actively contribute to new employment opportunities for the EU and the world. High-paid jobs are to be created since technology- oriented companies typically employ highly skilled employees. 
	Increased Entrepreneurial Activity  The innovative and international character of the Virtual Incubator, will create awareness of entrepreneurs and offer an easily accessible and friendly online environment that supports collaborative business creation across all incubation phases including the yet unexplored Interest phase. 
- Entrepreneurial Business Development Networks - The growing international entrepreneurial network of individuals, start-ups, universities, mentors, investors, government, and all other network stakeholders including the community, will stimulate the establishment of long-term, strong-ties and relationships that can create on-going business opportunities for all involved parties

Accelerate the transfer of innovative applications and services to the market

VOICE delivers its value proposition virtually via the Internet. This will enable it to provide its service offering to the international B2C, B2B and B2G targeted market segments in a fast, efficient and cost effective way, considering its strategic reach and impact. The VOICE ecosystem enables individuals that aspire to become entrepreneurs to tap into the collective intelligence of the crowd. Students, women, unemployed, individuals residing in remote areas will be offered the capability to engage and collaborate with entrepreneurs and mentors across the world in a friendly and engaging way.


Deployment of services sustaining the European  and global social model of an inclusive, cohesive information society for all, stimulating new activities leading to job creation; improving the competitiveness of European enterprises, in particular SMEs and strengthen the internal market

VOICE provides an innovative virtual platform that will facilitate open community collaboration towards entrepreneurship. As such VOICE bridges the gap between entrepreneurial need and action, reducing barriers to entry for both individuals and embryonic start-ups. VOICE  ecosystem provides business, technical and community services so as to enhance start-up growth and maximize their chances of survival. At the same time VOICE will act as an innovation marketplace and a global investment opportunity ecosystem for the B2B community (i.e., investment community, companies); as well as a medium for universities consulting companies and individuals to offer their services. By fulfilling these goals and supporting individuals and companies, across all stages from the need, to intellectual property ownership and control, to start-up creation, this virtual incubation ecosystem will thus contribute to the creation of jobs and wealth across the broader community. 

VOICE serves as inclusive, social entrepreneurship ecosystem that will offer an easily accessible online environment to support collaborative business creation. The online character of the VOICE will stimulate further the entrepreneurial and innovation activity by weakening existing imbalances for entrepreneurs between urban and rural areas by offering equal opportunities to individuals that do not live in major cities, to women and community groups with disabilities.

The phenomenon has been well documented, hyperbolic discounting is the human tendency to prefer smaller payoffs now over larger payoffs later, which leads one to largely disregard the future when it requires sacrifices in the present.
""Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die."" It's an appealing philosophy to some, but for an average person in the modern world, on any given day we are roughly 26,000 times more likely to be wrong than right about tomorrow's survivability. More often than not, one must answer for all reckless consumption and merriment; yet most of us continue to make choices which are detrimental to our futures.
 
Our Solution:
We believe that a behavioural change intervention, at a social-network level, is required if we are to calm our rate of consumption to manageable levels.
 
We have leveraged behavioural economics techniques from the evidence based, Road Safety  Average Speed Camera Intervention to allow people to self-select themselves to a programme of social surveillance, using wearable devices to remotely compete in games of discipline against friends and family, and by so doing maintain target behaviours that reduce consumption rates or increase activity levels to compensate for consumption rates.
 
Why Now:
The explosion of sensors we are witnessing today is spurring innovation across industry due to their effectiveness of price point, innovation in what can be measured, and the existence of ubiquitous networks to allow the aggregation of that data. 

For the first time we have the technology to monitor and validate adherence to target behaviour remotely. Nowhere is that more important than in the health and wellbeing space, where the world faces epic challenges coming from an aging population, a centralised health system that is straining to scale to current demands, and growing health concerns due to obesity and diabetes.

Lokalizo through its partnership with Voices of Youth Maps offers a youth friendly technology that can be used by trained young people to securely collect stories and reports regarding their neighborhood.

Aggregated reports serve as a powerful tool to promote interventions by the community and its leaders to achieve the desired changes. The Lokalizo project addresses 9 thematic categories: walking hazards, accumulation of garbage, collapse risks, water management, recreational parks, urban traffic, sanitation problems, urban green spaces and forests, response to humanitarian disasters. 

(In respect to the latter category and in light of the recent floods in the Balkans, our team has been invited at the Mikser Festival 2014 in Belgrade to present how youth-led initiatives similar to Lokalizo can respond to such crisis in the future.)

Our team has been able to create a solid circle of stakeholders in the city of Prishtina, while we are working everyday to expand this circle. Simultaneously, we are looking at opportunities to expand the service offered through Lokalizo to other cities, with the goal to stretch on national level. 

The social enterprise contributes positively to social change by empowering a number of people who join us as youth mappers. While the activism of young people pushes governmental institutions to join us as stakeholders and collaborate to jointly improve the quality of life in our communities.  Lokalizo successfully creates feedback loops where direct communication between agents of positive change, elected representatives, and those responsible to provide remedies can easily collaborate to establish the needed results.

free tool to report and react, and to raise the visibility of ecological issues in local communities by centralizing them in one place,identified with the description and location (coordinates), and displayed on the map for anyone to see and react.

Our first goal is to empower people to actively participate in reporting and resolving ecological issues in their local communities and to share positive stories about individuals and organizations involved in resolving ecology problems.

In order to accomplish this goal we have to create a hustle free tool for people to use for reporting and centralized location for reported issues to be stored and displayed for everyone to see and react.

We believe that our project has much larger prospect beyond this, and that it will grow into network which will include not only individuals and NGOs but also municipal and governmental bodies, schools etc. Also, since it deals with issues that are global, we believe that it has potential to easily spread outside country borders and become global.

This project will give people opportunity to get involved. At the same time their involvement will leverage visibility of these issues and put public pressure on perpetrators through social network. This should result in significant reduction of number of actions that are harmful for the environment and in increase of positive actions done by individuals and organizations.

There are two reasons why we focus on social entrepreneurs : one because they are actors of social innovation which is the mission of Babele and the other is because they are often idealistic and need real help in defining their business plan in order to create their business.

In order to measure our future impact, we have established the following indicators:
	The percentage of ideas in the platform that become self-sustained projects after one year. We will compare this success rate with the average success rate of entrepreneurs in order to measure our own impact;
	The evolution of indicators measuring the intensity of cooperation on the platform:
	percentage of projects addressing requests to the community;
	percentage of requests answered by the community with a positive rating given by the entrepreneur (the answer was useful to him);
	number of people who join the team of a project thanks to their relevant contribution to the platform.

The three main outcomes of the project will be:

1. Older people in sheltered housing schemes have improved quality of life including being less isolated, more mentally active, better informed and better off financially because they are more digitally included.
2. Older people involved in the intergenerational theme of the project have increased contact across the generations leading to more developed online skills for older people and better communication skills for young people leading to a better understanding of each other for both groups.

Social computing is firstly seen as the computational facilitation of service centric design that integrates the Web of People with the Internet of things, that shortens the feedback loop in adaptive systems and services, and that enables the service to be carried out in in a more flattened and bottom up social structure. With the facilitation service design can be carried out in an interactive and sustainable process. In this process data and input can be collected social interaction among the uses and the stakeholders and from the behavior of the users and the products, analyzed and quickly or directly fed back to the process. There is a need to investigate how to tightly combine and coordinate these computational, physical and social elements to facilitate the service and the design process of it.

Social computing is also seen as a computational platform for social innovation. The aim of the research in this respect is to develop methods, tools and techniques based on social computing to support design as social innovation and design for social innovation. In the case of design as social innovation, the research shall investigate how social computing can be used to support the collaborative design activities by the designers as well as other stakeholders including the end users and to enable collective creativity and intelligence in dealing with the complexity of the systems of today. In the case of design for social innovation, the research shall investigate how to use social computing for design to trigger and support social innovation that leads to societal transformations, by introducing design perspectives and design intervention in a social context.

Social computing could be used for validating design in earlier phases of the process. It is interesting to investigate how social computing could be utilized as a simulation platform for earlier concepts  in this case physical prototypes might be still be necessary but the situational context (people, other things and the environment) can be brought in or closer in order to quest the concept earlier.

The perspective and the competency of using social computing as an enabler in design should be implemented in the design education if the aim of the education is creating intelligent systems, products and related services in a social context. This research should investigate how this can be carried out in a competency-centered learning process, and how to utilize the social computing technologies to facilitate this process.","open knowledge, open data","open source, open data, machine learning, sensors and internet of things, geotagging, social media, big data, mobile apps, social networks",ef1956b9-ca89-b40d-6a97-b2845d010dda,

The social, economical and environmental details of real communities are conveyed inside the social network. It is based on the assimilation of data coming from low-cost sensors deployed and worn by citizens in houses, workplaces, transportation, public spaces; citizens wear, carry and place sensors as a sign of community commitment. Individual, quantitative contribution is minimal; but collective, qualitative contribution is enormous, because of the ubiquity and capillarity achieved mixing public and private mobile communications infrastructure.

The social network is extended with a new layer featuring efficient access to smart community and city managed data, information and knowledge; both (1) emerging open-data models and (2) integrated development environments (enabling community members to easily create and deploy smart-community applications) play major roles in promoting crowd-sourced services, bottom-up innovation and citizen empowerment.

Medhance has benefits for each, which the current methods do not provide. There are a vast number and a range of patient requiring different clinical skills thus it cannot be quantified into a single figure but this is a huge potential audience.

Medhance will also benefit patients who are poorly educated, in a low socio-economic class, in an ethnic minority speaking little English or require a carer. Even though it takes these patients into account, it is aimed at all patients requiring the use of a clinical skill no matter what their background is. Thus could potentially have a dangerous result of not knowing how to perform their clinical skill correctly, due to not having suitable and validated resources targetted to them. While patients who are well educated or in a high socioeconomic class have access to a wider range of facilities along with better understanding. This is reflected, not just across the UK but throughout Europe. 

For patients who are poorly educated, the features in Medhance are perfectly suited to them. So if they are not able to read or have poor literacy skills along with poor understanding of complex medical terminology, then the patient can be shown how to perform the clinical skill via a video, which they can watch at their own pace or repeatedly if they wanted to. 

For patients who are in a lower socio-economic class and cannot afford the access to advanced resources, Medhance does not charge them. This is because the content is free as the healthcare provider covers the cost for a small fee. This allows them to have the same benefits as higher socio-economic classes. 

For patients who are from ethic minorities and do not speak much English, Medhance overcomes this barrier by making the information available in several languages. Thus having the information already translated does not make them rely on translators or using relatives as translators, which can be life-threatening when used for medical information. 

For patients who require a carer such a specific elderly patients, Medhance allows there carers to use this if they were not present when showed the skill. It also has advantages for patients who are affected by more than one medical condition and require the use of several clinical skills. This allows the easy access for them, as the information is in one place. Thus Medhance will be a useful resource for these patients. 

There are several recipients of Medhance who will take advantage of its features and will have a social impact on them as medical education tool. This impact will empower patients by enhancing their knowledge, quality of care and overall health outcomes. Therefore, also preventing hospital admissions and reducing the number of emergency department attendees. Most importantly it will improve their quality of lives.

Through planning of a new district in Bod we have the ability to acquire knowledge about uncertainty urban planning in a long term perspective using international environments. In such work, we need contact with environments that are good on provident planning, future-oriented technology development, climate change, transport development, geopolitics, etc.
The four major transport modalities in Norway (aviation, road, rail and sea transport) meet in Bod. Bod Airport is one of six national airports and Bodo harbor is one of seven designated national ports. Bodo is only place in Norway where national port national airport, railway and road meet within walking distance. When developing new district and a new airport will these four transport carriers could be integrated within the same industry area. This opens unique opportunities for both freight and passenger transport, both in a national perspective but also in the arctic and global perspective.
A development of Bodo intermodal hub will also in a long term be associated with uncertainty in relation to developments in Northern Norway and the Arctic. Climate change and geopolitical challenges will provide guidance for the development of the Arctic and thus governs the possibilities inherent in the development of Bodo logistics hub in the Arctic.","open data, open networks, open knowledge, open hardware","3d printing, crowdsourcing, mobile apps, crowdmapping, big data, crowdfunding, social media, open data, social networks, personal monitoring, sensors and internet of things",3c60f5dc-dd50-b236-21b7-530d42e9f04d,

The game platform focuses on multiplayer mobile gaming that leverages the Future Internet technology in order to enable large groups of users to participate in innovative mobile gameplay experiences. A central theme of this new social gaming platform is moving beyond the traditional paradigm in which a user is fixed in front of a console or display. Instead, the game mechanics will blend virtual and real-world experiences so that location-aware games extend past our televisions, weaving the magic of gameplay into multiple real objects and locations. In this way, the game becomes an augmented version of the real world that delivers a more compelling experience than traditional console games or the simplistic social games","open knowledge, open data","mixed reality, open data, open source, social networks, smart city",7cbcd6c1-f42b-b682-e84f-899cc330b6d1,10/1/2015

With issue reporting being an easy and fun process, citizens will become more active and engaged with their government. Moreover, ImproveMyCity is expected to increase the citizens awareness about the various processes and players required to solve a certain type of problem (i.e. many are the cases that citizens dont know that their issue is under the jurisdiction of the general (and not the local) government until they receive this information from the feedback mechanism of the application). This direct communication is expected to make citizens more co-operative with their government and their fellow-citizens and contribute to their sense of purpose and meaning towards the empowerment of the citys collective awareness. Finally, by establishing more efficient mechanisms for spotting and fixing the problematic parts of a city the level of well-being and satisfaction is expected to improve among its citizens.","open knowledge, open data","crowdsourcing, open source, mobile apps, sensors and internet of things, open data",e8b3b15a-b7c7-1d28-c857-a3fb55183c27,

of University and Research of Italy for young reseachers under 30 years.
First Life proposes a new social network which revises the basis of existing ones and has the following
characteristics:
1) It offers a geo-referenced representation like Google Maps does, but it is more dense and interactive.
2) It does not have a global scope, but it is focused on neighours, the dimension where we live our
everyday life.
3) It is mediated in that every neighbourhood is associated with a journalist which re-elaborates the
information put by citizens on the social network and manages a local newspaper proposing topics of
interests for the citizens.
By more dense and interactive we mean that the citizens can not only put opinions on restaurants like it
happens now, but they can put information about every aspect of the local reality they live in, from
schools to playgrounds, from entertainment events to local news. First life will be populated with entities
downloaded from open data (hospitals, shops, etc.) or added by users, which can create their own forms
describing the fields of the entities and classifying them according to an ontology of social practices. For
every entity, users can add information, blogs, pictures, or organize online events, like chats to discuss
related issues.
The goal of First Life is to make citizens more connected, more conscious of the place they live in and
more active. First Life harvests the knowledge and services which are now scattered around many
websites often unknown to the wide public websites, focusing them on a local area. It reduces the
overloading of information by filtering them on a locality principle. It can be the basis for co-production
(in the sense of the Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom) and Do It Yourself activities, it can be used to advertise
new shops, services or events in the local area, it allows people to organize their own events, to start
discussions on local issues.
The business model ensuring the sustainability of the project is to be financed by advertisements and by
contribution of citizens which want to become stakeholders of the local newspapers. Starting from a first
test neighbourhood, First Life will be extended to other ones and other cities using a franchising
mechanism.
First Life respond to the worries raised by existing social networks, such Google+ and Facebook. First,
the so called filter bubble noted by Eli Pariser: the personalization of information from social media
closes us in a private world reducing the opportunities for serendipity. Second, the reduction of social
space by social media, leading to an urban desert: as Evgeny Morozov says, public space is only what
separates our home from the restaurant with good online reviews our Google Car is driving us to.","open knowledge, open networks, open data","online peer support, crowdsourcing, social networks, online notice board, geotagging, p2p   distributed exchange networks, crowdmapping, mobile apps",31803957-3003-c829-8ece-9f4e8620b679,12/1/2015

Inherited gaps that are related to with the educational, labor, social, participation, health development ... that have to do with human development.

And closing these gaps, for the first time, is in the hands of citizens themselves. Because technology gives us a chance, one for every single one, to become the main characters, technological social entrepreneurs, capable of changing the world. This transformation is the result of an informed and engaged citizenship. A citizenship that knows how to use the tools, applications, contents and technological services at its disposal to generate a wealthy and better world. Because addressing real needs is generating innovation and social change.

It?s an event-driven community of museum innovators that harnesses their collective energies over three days, and enables them to change the museum from within.

The Museomix project was founded in 2011 by five very different persons and entities working in the culture and innovation sectors: the agencies Nod-a and Buzzeum, the research laboratory Erasme, Samuel Bausson and Julien Dorra. It is now driven by an  active community of art and history enthusiasts, museum staff, innovators, designers, coders, community organizers, makers and tinkerers that grows each year, including The French Ministry of Cultural Affairs.

Why is Museomix here?
If we are not satisfied with the way museums work, why not make the museum we would love to visit and work for? Why not make it a creative platform? This is the question we asked when setting up Museomix.

We love museums, but sometimes it feels like museums don?t really love us back. They are filled with rules, shushing guards, admonitions against photography. They can give us a sense that we?re somewhere we don?t belong, where our rights and agency are diminished, where we are more limited than usual to do, or play, as we please.

Museum professionals ? especially those working in digital and the web ? are frequently frustrated: there are many new possibilities for mediation and the museum experience. They are discussed in conferences and prototyped in workshops. But when museum professionals try to bring these ideas back to their own museums, innovation can seem out of reach.

Museomix was born out of this frustration. It?s a way to bridge the gap between participatory web culture and institutional museum culture, between peer-to-peer logic and pyramidal organisation.

Museomix wants to demonstrate that museums can work differently, and that a disruptive experience can initiate change throughout an organisation.

Over three days Museomix make it happen for real in museums where people can be creative and have an immediate impact.

Beyond visitors: reaching out to museum user communities
Visitors want many things out of their museum visit: students, teachers, parents and children; designers, artists and photographers; tourists and researchers; amateurs and bloggers ? all have different motivations to visit.

If you look closely at their habits and practices, you?ll find that they are much more than visitors: they are really museum users.

Beyond simply watching, they seek diverse experiences: photographing, drawing, posing, dancing, learning, loitering, meeting, eating ? experiences that they like to share with friends, and that they can?t always have in museums.

Museomix opens the door to people who want to make a place for themselves. Museomix lets visitors imagine a cultural space that let them become engaged users and evolves with them.

The Museomix community shares a vision of today?s museum, co-edited in 2012:

a museum that is open and inclusive to people, their uses, and the use of their content;
a museum that is connected, and works outside-in with its user communities;
a participatory museum, where contemplating is one of many ways to relate artworks, where people can share and create ? a read-write museum.
Museomix allows users to own their experiences. Users help museums to change.","open data, open knowledge, open hardware, open networks","mobile apps, 3d printing, social media, crowdmapping, big data, online peer support, open source, social networks, machine learning, open data, personal monitoring, p2p   distributed exchange networks, sensors and internet of things",fd9f4213-f626-765e-76f9-07798e76f8ba,11/1/2014
